		I'm a stranger oh just like you don't you understand
		Oh stranger
		Silence stopped the time I can hear your heart
		Glimmer of your eyes reach me from the dark
		I'm dreaming or may be not clothing's falling down
		All matters we're giving up
		Cause nothing matters now
		Oh stranger

(2)		Flowers on the floor, all around your hair
		Morning at the door, I don't think you care
		You whisper in my ear, shiver in my arms
		Don't let it stop, don't go away
		Screaming in your eyes
		Oh stranger

!		Пpипeв

(3)		Between the walls and face to face. Oh stranger
		We won't have another chance. Oh stranger
		There won't be another night
		Oh stranger         With me tonight
		You're stranger     With me all night
		My stranger
