Radio Silence (1989)
		The Postcard

!		Проигрыш характерным песне ритмом: <F#m>,<D>,<F#m>,<Hm>

>		F#m         D
		This is a postcard
>		F#m                          Hm
		Saying I'm alright in this beautiful city
>		F#m          D
		This is a phon call
>		         F#m                 Hm
		Saying, yes, I am sleeping alone here
>		 G(III)                      D
		But the telephone lines are cut
>		Hm                F#m
		My hands can't hold the paper
>		 F#m    C      D
		You are on my mind

		Nobody knows your name here,
		Except when the moon is out
		And then they toss in their sleep
		Crying out for you to take them
		But me I cannot sleep,
		I cannot dream,
		My heart is shattered
		You are on my mind

>		F#m                                  D
		Once seven colors used to make men blind
>		     F#m                                   Hm
		And now we are like birds stuck in barbed wire
!		          <F#m>,<D>,<F#m>,<Hm>
		Shattered!

		Precise, like sunrise
		A child just like any other
		Made of the bones of the earth
		fragile and deathless
		Yes, I'm alright
		I'm a church,
		And I'm burning down

		You are on my mind

		And now we are like birds stuck in barbed wire

		Precise, like sunrise
		A child just like any other
		Made of the bones of the earth
		Fragile and deathless
		Yes, I'm alright
		I'm a church,

		You are on my mind...
